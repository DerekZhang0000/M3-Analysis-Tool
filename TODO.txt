1. Change x axis to time
2. Add slopes to data points
3. Change sliders to be input theoretical time / length
4. Add function to give us target length / time for placement we want to beat

5. Autonatically input (0 length, 60 seconds)
	Add comment to change M3 0 length time to real time performance if end user wants
